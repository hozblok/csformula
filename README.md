# csformula
C++ class for evaluating of formula expression specified by the string.

Inspired by the idea of the [calculation class Eval](http://mathgl.sourceforge.net/doc_en/Evaluate-expression.html) from the [MathGL](http://mathgl.sourceforge.net/) library.

Developed especially for use as part of the CAPSYS application (ver. 2.1).
